### 🎯 Project Overview

This repository showcases a project I developed during my time at a previous company.  
Due to NDA and company policies, I'm not permitted to share the source code or public deployment.  
However, I've included several UI screenshots to give a sense of the design, structure, and functionality.

As the **sole frontend developer**, I was fully responsible for the entire UI/UX implementation, including:

- Building responsive layouts using **Tailwind CSS**
- Creating reusable components with **React.js** and **Next.js**
- Integrating APIs and managing state with **ٍRedux** and **Axios**
- Implementing routing, error handling, and loading states
- Optimizing performance and ensuring cross-browser compatibility
- Closely collaborating with product and design teams

This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in a professional team environment,  
and helped strengthen my skills in scalable architecture, clean code practices, and component-based development.
